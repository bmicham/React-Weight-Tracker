![Preview](https://github.com/bmicham/React-Weight-Tracker/assets/60907784/c3657f59-b6a5-424a-9422-dbc22aa590c0)


> **Warning**
Data is wiped when computer is shutdown/restarted make sure to download data when done

## Download Data
Downloads the data that has been inputed into a JSON file

## Clear All Data
Clears all data entered and removes the saved localStorage data that was created

## Upload Data
Upload a JSON file of previously entered data

## Progress Tracker
This will show 2 graphs showing overall progression for your weight and calories. The top graph shows weight the target weight can be set at the bottom of the page this will also set the max y-axis to 5 lbs above your target weight.
The minimum weight value will the the bottom of the y-axis, I recommend 2-3 lbs below your minimum weight. 

## Weight/Calorie Tables
These allow you to individually edit all values that you have input. 

## Avoid Data Wipe
I would recommend using a free hosting site to use this. I use netlify.com, all you have to do is drag and drop the build folder into where it asks for the website output.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
